              My first programming language was R, which I learned for my final
              year dissertation in econometrics. We had had a STATA course in
              our 3rd year, but I knew I wanted to learn something more useful.
              When I graduated, I knew that I wanted to work in a role where I
              would get to program for the majority of my day, and the most
              logical opportunity was to pursue data analyst openings. The
              summer after I graduated, I taught myself Python and SQL, which I
              relied on exclusively for the first few years of my career.
              <br /><br />Our "source" index (as opposed to topic, beat, or
              byline indexing) provides a completely new dimension with which to
              explore storytelling. These new modular components would not only
              serve as a tool for auditing our sourcing diversity, they would
              also provide a new way for readers to search through our articles
              e.g. quotes from prospective homebuyers in the Midwest or comments
              from sociologists based out of NYC. "Pitched by a team from The
              Wall Street Journal working in New York and London, the experiment
              looked at breaking stories down into modules by identifying the
              people mentioned in different parts of them. By pulling out these
              blocks, allowing journalists to annotate the data in the content
              management system and then programmatically organising it, the
              team demonstrated how their prototype could be used to analyse the
              appearances of sources in stories in the hope of providing an
              audit for diversity and even a search tool for those working in
              the newsroom. The prototype tackled the challenge of gaining
              scalable and timely insight into sourcing in news. The judges
              commended the prototype's rapid feedback loop, allowing for more
              timely analysis and actionable insight rather than annual reports
              or bespoke analytics projects to tackle the same issues."
